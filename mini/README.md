# Small demos

The **mini** folder contains only individual demos with the smallest amount of code necessary to make something work, rather than having demos all in one project for a day.  This is to make it easier for us to see what is causing something to happen.

If there are any requests to go over past examples, we can start a new subdirectory within the "mini" examples and demonstrate the effects here.

## Animation Circle

Animation Circle (CSS3 Animations lecture, Slide 29) asks us to animate a circle from the top left of the page to the top right of the page, onwards to the bottom right of the page.  We use the **@keyframes** tag and apply an **animation** using the keyframe we specified.
